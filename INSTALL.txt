Prerequisites
=============

As it is designed on Java, you can use the client on any platform which has a virtual machine. Of 
course, a GNU/Linux based system would be better. 

 * Server *
  - Java (1.6+)
  - PostgreSQL (8.1 or better)
  - PostGIS (1.3 or better)
  - PgRouting
  
 * WebService *
  - Java (1.6+)
  - Tomcat (1.5 or better)
  - Same database as the server
 
 * Desktop Client *
  - Java (1.6+)
 
 * Mobile Client *
  - Java (1.6+)
  - PostgreSQL (8.1 or better)
  - PostGIS (1.3 or better)
  - PgRouting
  
//TODO how to configure postgresql on the mobile client

If you want to compile the code, you will need Maven.
  
Hardware Requirements
=====================

//TODO better

As long as you can run PostgreSQL and Java... it should be enough. Of course, the better hardware,
the better performance.


How to INSTALL
==============

//TODO pre-compiled jars?

We try to do it as simple as posible, so we use Maven. If you have Maven installed on your computer,
you just need the source code. //TODO url svn?

Configuration
-------------

Once you have the source code, you can configure your environment. The configuration file
is the pom.xml file of the parent folder. There you can configure the parameters at the
end of the file. The most important parameter is the 'host' parameter. You have to change
it to the ip/server name of the database.
 
To compile the mobile version, you have to execute maven with the "-P mobile" argument.
You cannot compile a desktop and a mobile client at the same time.

Compiling
---------

After configuring, you can compile it with a simple
     'mvn package'
on the //TODO {project.name} folder.

//TODO mobile/desktop profile

Once you have all the package done, you can find all the generated jars on the target 
folder of every sub-project, as usual with maven.
